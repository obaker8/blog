title: "7 Ways to Protect Your Dog’s Paws this Winter Season"

Winter is our dog’s favourite season by far! We always joke that she gets her Summer body in the Winter time because she is so much more active and playful in the snow. The minute we open the door she runs out to stick her face in the snow and gets this playful look on her face. She could spend hours frolicking in the snow.

As fun as the snow can be, it can also be ruff on our dog’s paws. Different breeds have different ways to cope with the cold weather, but all dog’s require a bit of extra care on those cute little paws during the winter months. My skin tends to crack and dry up in the Winter, so I have to over moisturizer to help take care of my skin. Our dog’s paws require the same attention! Snow, ice and the cold weather can take a tole on our dog’s bare paws, but that isn’t all. We also have ice-melting agents to worry about. If you’re walking your dog on public sidewalks or paths, your dog is most likely walking in a variety of chemical filled ice-melting agents. These chemicals can wear down the paws or be ingested if your dog lick their paws after walks.

Luckily, we’re sharing 7 (easy) ways to protect your dog’s paws this Winter Season…

**1. Booties**
The first way to protect your dog’s paws is to put booties on. Booties are first on our list because if your dog likes wearing booties, then you have won the lottery! Booties minimize contact with chemicals and can prevent snow, salt and sand from getting lodged between bare paws and causing irritation. Unfortunately, many of our dogs cannot stand wearing booties and for that reason we have 6 other ways you can protect your dog’s paws…so read on. 

**2. Trim Hair**
Trim the hair that sticks out in-between the paws to minimize the clinging of ice balls, salt crystals and de-icing chemicals that can dry on and damage the bare paws. 

**3. Paw Balm**
Massage paw jelly or balm into paw pads before going outside to protect from salt and chemical agents. Once coming home, after towelling off, you can re-apply to heal chapped paws. We’ve been using Bee Savvy paw balm and it’s been working wonders! It can also be used in the Summer to prevent chapping from hot pavement, so it’s a good investment. Vaseline is also an acceptable alternative. 

**4. Wipe Paws**
Always make sure to wipe your dog’s paws off with warm water and pat dry with a clean towel when they come inside. It’s extremely important to get all the salt, ice and dirt off.

**5. Pet Friendly De-Icers**
If you need to use de-icers on your own sidewalk and driveway, you should use pet friendly de-icers, and encourage your neighbours to do the same. You can order a pet-friendly de-icer online from Safe Paw or find a variety of pet-friendly de-icers from local hardware stores, like Canadian Tire. 

**6. Check Paws**
Check your dog’s paws regularly. Ensure that the pads are crack and abrasion free by gently grasping their paw in your hand and visually inspecting their pads for any injuries or abnormalities. Press down gently on the pads with your thumb and make note of any pain or discomfort this action might cause.  

**7. Shorter Walks**
Keep an eye on the clock on cold days. Frostbite can affect a dog’s paw (and other parts of the body) so we like the idea of more ‘shorter’ walks.
