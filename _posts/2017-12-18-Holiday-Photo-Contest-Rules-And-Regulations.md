COSTUME CONTEST

The most wonderful time of the year is upon us!'Tis the season of giving, and we have some gifts to give to a few lucky doggies. Warm nights by the fire, rocking Christmas hats, frolicking in the snow and photos with Santa. These are just a few of the pics we want to see from you! Show us how you and your pooch celebrate the holiday season by uploading and hashtagging #FureveryHoliday2017 on all your pics to be entered into our Holiday Photo Contest (running now on Instagram)! The contest is running until December 23rd, so you still have time to enter. 

We have partnered up with amazing Canadian dog brands to give you and your dogs early Christmas presents. We will be picking the top 3 best photos and rewarding those dogs with a one-month subscription box from our friends at <a href="http://www.puptowngirlbox.com/">Puptown Girl Box</a>,an assortment of homemade treats from <a href="https://spoilthedogbakery.squarespace.com/">Spoil The Dog Bakery</a> and a brand new custom collar from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/PoochandTabby/">Pooch & Tabby</a>
