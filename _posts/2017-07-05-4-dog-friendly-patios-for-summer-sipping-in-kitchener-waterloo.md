title: "4 Dog-Friendly Patios for Summer Sipping in Kitchener-Waterloo"
date: 2017-07-05

Here in Ontario, most folks know we only have two seasons - winter, and construction. But the nice thing about construction season is that it also goes by another, more exciting name: patio season! And now that the days are longer and the nights are warmer, just about everyone (and every dog) would rather be sipping something on a patio than cooped up indoors.

But bringing your four-legged friend along for a patio adventure isn't always easy. Most places do not allow dogs, and the ones that do often require dogs to be tied up on the opposite side of the patio, meaning your seating options are limited to the tables around the edge. But there are a few stalwart dog-friendly establishments that welcome pooches with open arms. Here's a few of them:

**The Boathouse - Kitchener**

While they set a three-dog maximum on the patio at any given time, Victoria Park gem The Boathouse is dog-friendly, at least as of 2016. Boasting an unbeatable view of the lake in Victoria Park, and located along one of the main walking trails, The Boathouse is a great place to start or finish a walk. And with an extensive menu of food and drink options, you won't go away hungry.

**Beertown - Waterloo**

With 30 tap lines, and the Paddletron 3000, Beertown is a Waterloo staple that also happens to feature a massive, dog-friendly patio. Nestled in the heart of downtown Waterloo, Beertown is close to ample parking, and has both a mile-long beer menu, and great food. When you're on a date with your dog, what more could you ask for?

**The Yeti Cafe - Kitchener**

The Yeti has been a favourite of mine since I discovered the Terry Pender sandwich and their fantastic selection of coffees. While they don't serve alcohol, their location on a quiet side-street in downtown Kitchener makes them an excellent space to sip an Americano and watch the world go by. Yeti's patio is a bit small, so they typically ask dog owners to sit closer to the front where it's a bit easier to move around.

**Balzac's Coffee - Kitchener**

Another popular coffee hangout, Balzac’s in the Tannery is a must-visit for techies visiting Communitech and Velocity with their four-legged co-founders. They even have a water bowl on the patio so fido can grab a quick drink too. Balzac's is an institution in Southern Ontario, and their location in the Tannery was not only one of their first, but also their most popular. I recommend any of their specialty lattes - especially the maple ones in fall!

**Honourable Mention - Craft Breweries**

Since they don't typically serve food, many breweries are dog-friendly too. Block Three Brewing in St. Jacobs has held dog-related events in their brewery in the past, and is proudly owned by dog-lovers. Royal City Brewing in Guelph is also a popular dog-friendly hot spot, and I take our rescue pup Clara there on a regular basis. While not every brewery has a patio, many offer year-round beer flights in a dog-friendly atmosphere. Reach out to your local brewery and ask if it's okay to bring your pooch - they're typically very responsive on social media, and the worst they can say is no!

**Where am I missing?**

These are dog-friendly patios that I've confirmed, but I'm sure there are many others - if you've found any sunny sipping spots that are okay with pooches, please let me know in the comments!
