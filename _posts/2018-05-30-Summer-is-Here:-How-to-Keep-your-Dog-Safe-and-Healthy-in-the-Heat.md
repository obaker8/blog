Here in Ontario, it seems like we've completely skipped Spring and jumped right into Summer! Of course we're all pumped to put our parkas away and bring out the shorts and flip flops, but one thing we need to remember is that our dogs wear fur coats year round! With our excitement for the warm weather, we need to also take extra precautions to make sure our pets stay healthy and cool during the heat waves of summer. Here are some of our tips for enjoying summertime with your dog. 

1. Shorter Walks - Ideally in Morning and Evening 

2. Keep your Dog Hydrated 

3. Cool your Dogs Off: AC, Ice Cubes, Fans

4. NEVER EVER Leave your Dog in Car 

5. Avoid Hot Sidewalks 

6. Groom 

7. Watch for Heat Stroke
