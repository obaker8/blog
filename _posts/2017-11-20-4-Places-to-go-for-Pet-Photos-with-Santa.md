Last week we wrote a post on the dog blog outlining our favourite Holiday Photos with your Dog, check it out <a 
href="http://http://blog.furevery.com/6-Of-the-GREATEST-Holiday-Photo-Shoots-With-Dogs-D/">here</a>. While we are on the topic
of Holiday photos, we've decided that no Holiday can be complete without taking your dog to get a photo with
the big jolly man himself; Santa Claus! So this week we're sharing a list of businesses that are opening their doors (or
chimneys) to Mr. Claus this year, and inviting all the nice doggos to come get their picture taken with Santa.

Our four-legged furbabies have been (mostly) good all year and they deserve to sit on Santa's lap and tell the man what is on
their wish list this year! We've found 4 local businesses in the Kitchener-Waterloo area that are hosting Pet Photo Days with
Santa.

Below are the business names, dates and location. Will you be taking your pet(s) for their photos with Santa?
