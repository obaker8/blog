Ah our favourite time of the year! The time of hot apple cider, Mariah Carey’s Christmas album, Christmas onesie wearing and
of course, gift giving!   

It can be overwhelming, expensive and just plain difficult to get the perfect gift for your loved ones…so we’ve decided to
lend a helping paw. We’ve rounded up a few of our favourite gifts for your very own fur baby or for that crazy dog lady/man in
your life. We love supporting fellow Canadian companies, so we have put a preference on showcasing Canadian gifts below! 

So refill that cup of hot cocoa (with or without Baileys…we won’t judge), give the dog a bone, snuggle on the couch and start
shopping!
