The sun is finally starting to shine, the temperature is rising, and our dogs are begging us for summer adventures! Dog-friendly community events will be showcased in our app, so we want to give a sneak peak of the kinds of events that you can expect to see! Our soft-launch is happening next month in the KW area, but some of these events are happening THIS month, and we don't want you to miss out!

Check-out a few sneak peaks of the dog-friendly happenings in the KW area, and beyond, over the next few months: 

**1. Woofstock May 27- May 28 in Toronto**
Woofstock is the largest outdoor festival for dogs in all of North America! Woofstock was the first festival to allow people to celebrate their dogs, indulge them, party with them and let them show off their special talents in fun and wacky contests and fashion shows. There isn’t a toy, fashion line, accessory, and type of treat or exclusive service for dogs that you can’t find at Woofstock. It is hosted in a pawsitively dog friends area of Toronto, the Toronto beaches! Purchase tickets here:https://www.tix123.com/tix123/eTic.cfm?code=WOOF17

**2. The Dog Haus Meditation Walk in Kitchener**
Meditation walks are a great opportunity to walk as a pack and practice calm energy and relaxed on leash walking. Calm your mind and enjoy the beauty of nature with other dog owners in your community. The Dog Haus conducts a meditation walk every month, and the next one is happening in June with the location to be determined. Check out their Facebook page for more details and to stay up to date on their upcoming meditation walks:

**3. Dog Lovers Day June 24-25 in Guelph**
Held at Riverside Park in Guelph, both you and your canine friends will discover a wonderland of entertainment for the family dog to enjoy! Entrance is by donation to the PTSD Service Dogs. Come on out to this FUN event from 10 a.m. to 4p.m where your dog can enjoy a run on the lure course, see an energy healer at the Animal Healing Touch booth for FREE healing touch, play in the fenced in leash free Doggie Play Zone or participate in the Best Dressed Dog contest. There will be numerous pet-related vendors on site for your shopping pleasure, and a few products for humans too! Check out their website for more details (and more locations):

**4. The Dog Tales Festival 2017 August 26-27 in Toronto**
The Dog Tales Festival is a unique festival experience in celebration of rescued animals. It is also the perfect time for animal lovers to discover new and exciting products and services for their pets, and enjoy vegetarian and vegan cuisine. Dog Tales is located in King City, just outside of Toronto, but the drive is so worth it! And if you need another reason to attend the Dog Tales Festival, Furevery will be in attendance with a booth! We'd love to meet you! Check out the video from their 2016 Festival, and keep checking back into their website for more details on the upcoming 2017 Festival:

**5. Surf Dogs at Bingemans, Date TBD in Kitchener**
Get stoked for the annual Surf Dogs event held at Bingemans every September. The date hasn't been set yet, but usually runs mid-September right before they close down the pool! The most fearless dogs will jump on their boards (or just splash in water) and “hang 20” in the wave pool. This event must be seen to be believed! Bring the whole family for a rad time, goodies and fun! Have a small pooch? Have them catch a wave during the, exclusive small dog only pool time! We will showcase this event in the app once we go live! 

Right now we're showing off organized dog-friendly community events, but we're also working on showcasing dog-friendly establishments, like local patios, breweries, hotels and more!

Will you and your pooch be attending one of these dog friendly events?
