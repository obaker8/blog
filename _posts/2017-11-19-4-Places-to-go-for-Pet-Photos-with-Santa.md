Last week we wrote a post on the dog blog outlining our favourite Holiday Photos with your Dog, check it out <a href="http://http://blog.furevery.com/6-Of-the-GREATEST-Holiday-Photo-Shoots-With-Dogs-D/">here</a>. While we
were chatting about Holiday photos, we remembered that no Holiday can be complete without taking your dog to get a photo with
the big jolly man himself; Santa Claus! So this week we're sharing a list of businesses that are opening their doors (or
chimneys) to Mr. Claus early this year, and inviting all the nice doggos to come get their picture taken with Santa. 

Our four-legged furbabies have been good all year and they deserve to sit on Santa's knee and tell the man what is on their
wish list this year! We've found 4 local businesses in the Kitchener-Waterloo area that are hosting Pet Photo Days with Santa.
