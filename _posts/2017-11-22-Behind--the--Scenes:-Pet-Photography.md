<i>This is our first post of the 'Behind-the-Scenes' blog post series. We are going behind-the-scenes with a business in the dog industry ONCE A MONTH. So stay tuned for more posts as we get down and dirty with various businesses serving our pups</i>

To kick things off with our first post in the 'Behind-the-Scenes' series we sat down with Stephen, the talented photographer
behind the lense at Edgar and Pooch. Edgar and Pooch is a pet photography business located in Kitchener, Ontario. They create
professional portraits of canines that reveal their true personality. His shots capture life, love and happiness. As clich√© as
it is, his photographs are worth a thousand words. 

We went behind-the-scenes to see him work his magic with local dog celebrity; Janie Willow (@janiewillow). Stephen captures
the dog in essence, but is always open to customers bringing in props and costumes to make the shots more vibrant. Stephen encourages parents to take their pooches for a long walk beforehand and bring toys and treats to the studio with them. The garage-turned-studio is a warm and comforting space that has been made totally dog friendly. Dog's can roam the space, sniff it out and get comfortable with the equipement before sitting pretty for some glamour shots. 

Once the dog has warmed up to the space, Stephen begins with raw photos of the dog to get the dog used to the camera flashing and check lighting. Then the dog parent and Stephen collaborate on which props or outfits to incorporate into various shots. Stephen's energy in his studio relaxes the dog. You will hear Stephen mutter "beautiful", "gorgeous", "good girl", "Look over here", "amazing", "so pretty"...throughout the session. Janie responded so well to this words of encouragement. Once and a while he will squeak a squeeky toy or ask the parent to reward the dog with treats. His sessions run for about 45 minutes, and his utmost importance is always on ensuring the dog is still happy!
