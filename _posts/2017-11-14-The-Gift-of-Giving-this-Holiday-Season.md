title: "The Gift of Giving this Holiday Season"

The snow is beginning to fall, coffee shops have their holiday cups and the trees are being decorated, which means the Holiday
season is almost here. When we think of the Holiday season we think of warm apple cider, the smell of balsam fir, a warm lit
fireplace and presents under the tree. It can be easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of the holiday season, but I
know a lot of us love the gift of giving during the Holiday season. We get joy from watching others open presents on Christmas
morning, and I have a feeling all the animal lovers out there would sleep peacefully knowing they’ve given a gift that has
helped a homeless cat or dog during the holiday season.

Together we can help make sure that Santa visits everyone, including the four-legged creatures waiting on their forever homes
at the shelter. Every year, the local Humane Societies releases their ‘wish lists’ of items that are needed most. Many of us
have these items laying around at home or are willing to purchase a few of these items to help spread the holiday cheer at the
Humane Society. Take a look at the wish list below and consider making a trip to your local Humane Society this season for the
ultimate #giftofgiving.
