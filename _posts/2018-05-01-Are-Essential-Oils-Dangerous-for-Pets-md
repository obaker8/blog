Essential  oils  have  gained massive popularity over the past few years. This influx is due, in large part, to essential oils being adopted for frequent, personal use topically, orally and through aromatherapy. The  natural  oils are  great  and  have  various  health  benefits,  but  what  many  people  don’t  know  is  that some  can be toxic  to  your  pets. Cats and dogs have an enhanced sense of smell, so diffusers and un-diluted oil smells can be overwhemling for our pets. 

We  have  created  a  list  of  oils  that  can be toxic for dogs and  cats,  as  well  as  oils  that  are  great  for  your  pets  health! Adverse reactions to oils include squinting, excessive drooling, scratching, increased breathing rate and lethargy. This list is not inclusive, as all pets may react differently, but this should serve as a guidance on what precautions to take.

Although these oils are known to be pet friendly, it is important to use precautions and beaware of signs that may indicate your pet is having an allergic reaction to your oils. We recommend placing your diffuser a good distance from your pet, diluting oils with water and storing oils in safe places away from pets. 

We personally love the essential oil popularity and know that if we take the above precautions and avoid harmful oils, our pets can benefit too.
